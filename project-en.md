##### AN DIE HOFFNUNG

Elpis (Hope, Hoffnung) appears in ancient Greek mythology with the story of Zeus and Prometheus. Prometheus stole fire from the god Zeus, which infuriated the supreme god. In turn, Zeus created a box that contained all manners of evil, unbeknownst to the receiver of the box. Pandora opened the box after being warned not to, and unleashed a multitude of harmful spirits that inflicted plagues, diseases, and illnesses on mankind. Inside the box, however, there was also an unreleased healing spirit named Hope. From ancient times, people have recognized that a spirit of hope had the power to heal afflictions and helps them bear times of great suffering, illnesses, disasters, loss, and pain. 
Anne-Sophie Sevens, Bastian Kohl and Julie Delbart tell together a story named “An die Hoffnung” (“Oh hope”). The recital is build around romantic themes such as love, nature, death, existential fear, human quest, desire and hope. Questions and answers constitute the sequence, and many emotions will be expressed and somehow, all chosen works express a notion of hope. Anne-Sophie, Bastian and Julie’s performance at their recital concentrates mainly on works of L.v. Beethoven and F. Schubert.

##### DUO ANKA 

Belgian soprano Anne-Sophie Sevens and Belgian harpist Karen Peeters form the DUO ANKA. After the success of their first public performance, they decided to develop a repertoire for their voice-harp duo. They are currently working on a varied program, including their favorite repertoire, the German romantic lied, but also on the development of works from the French repertoire.
Maurice Ravel's Cinq mélodies populaires grecques, in their exceptional version for voice and harp, have a central place in their program. This young Belgian duo has yet in his repertoire works by Bellini, Bizet, Debussy, Ravel, Schubert and Strauss.

##### BETWEEM DREAM & REALITY 

A person is always in a dilemma of reality and dreams. The one that everyone runs from and considers hard to believe is - the reality. People love to dream. They dream of beautiful things, beautiful places, exciting adventures but once something bad crosses their mind they consider it as a nightmare. 
Just as an umbrella cannot be used without rain and sun, water cannot be held without a container and clock cannot run without arms, similarly reality cannot exist without dreams.

##### AUF FLÜGELN DES GESANGES

The Wesendonck-Lieder of Richard Wagner (1813-83) are composed on poems written by Mathilde Wesendonck and constitute one of the most beautiful expressions of universal love. The artistic skills of the lovers, the composition and the poetry, are unified in one single creation. Mathilde Wesendonck was married and suffered due to her impossible love for Richard Wagner. The same context of an impossible love was the inspiration for the later Tristan und Isolde with the sublime Liebenstod-scene of Isolde in which earthly love evolves in transcendental love. Wesendonck-Lieder no. 3 Im Treibhaus and no. 5 Träume were a musical draft for this opera. I considered it would be interesting to complement the program of the Wesendonck Lieder, with some Lieder from the repertoire. We can find in the additional chosen pieces analogous perspectives as those opened by the poems of Mathilde Wesendonck. Im Treibhaus we notice the negative look on reality. The I-person believes there must be another place where she would be free. Therefore we can consider the Palmenhaus as a metafore for her own ‘Golden Cage’. In Schmerzen the I-person is suffering from the knowledge that what she had positively experienced is gone. At the end of the Wesendonck Lieder cycle she will find peace again. In Träume, no. 5 of the cycle, she can dream and she finds what she was longing for in Im Treibhaus. In that way we can see the last song as an answer on Im Treibhaus:

«Wohl, ich weiß es, arme Pflanze; Ein Geschicke teilen wir, Ob umstrahlt von Licht und Glanze, Unsre Heimat ist nicht hier! » - Im Treibhaus (M. Wesendonck)

«Träume, wie wenn Frühlingssonne Aus dem Schnee die Blüten küßt, Daß zu nie geahnter Wonne Sie der neue Tag begrüßt. » - Träume (M. Wesendonck)
