##### DUO ANKA 

Belgian soprano Anne-Sophie Sevens and Belgian harpist Karen Peeters form the DUO ANKA. After the success of their first public performance, they decided to develop a repertoire for their voice-harp duo. They are currently working on a varied program, including their favorite repertoire, the German romantic lied, but also on the development of works from the French repertoire.
Maurice Ravel's Cinq mélodies populaires grecques, in their exceptional version for voice and harp, have a central place in their program. This young Belgian duo has yet in his repertoire works by Bellini, Debussy, Massenet, Ravel, Schubert, Schumann and Strauss.
