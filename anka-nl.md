##### DUO ANKA 

Belgian soprano Anne-Sophie Sevens and Belgian harpist Karen Peeters form the DUO ANKA. After the success of their first public performance, they decided to develop a repertoire for their voice-harp duo. They are currently working on a varied program, including their favorite repertoire, the German romantic lied, but also on the development of works from the French repertoire.
Maurice Ravel's Cinq m√©lodies populaires grecques, in their exceptional version for voice and harp, have a central place in their program. This young Belgian duo has yet in his repertoire works by Bellini, Bizet, Debussy, Ravel, Schubert and Strauss.
