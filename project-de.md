##### BETWEEM DREAM & REALITY 

##### “How hard would you work, and for how long, if you knew you could have your dream for sure ?”
Our past and present is what is reality. Then why people are always concerned with future ? Future is a mixture of unbalanced positive and negative thoughts, becoming blind-folded to our present and sometimes a lot of unknown preparations.
A person is always in a dilemma of reality and dreams. The one that everyone runs from and considers hard to believe is - the reality. It hits us like wounds from thousand thorns but is what is actually happening. Some people being strong by heart, face it. But what is their strategy? They dwell in a world where they take it hard to believe that they actually face reality, so they repeat to others and to themselves that “I believe in reality”. What are they doing? Believing themselves or making others believe.

People love to dream. They dream of beautiful things, beautiful places, exciting adventures but once something bad crosses their mind they consider it as a nightmare. What people forget is that dreams are the sum of the thoughts that grow in their mind on a daily basis.
Reality and dreams are often misunderstood. When someone’s dream turn into reality they become believer’s of “Dream come true”. But when their dream fails to stand as reality they start believing on “Dreams can never come true”.
Just as an umbrella cannot be used without rain and sun, water cannot be held without a container and clock cannot run without arms, similarly reality cannot exist without dreams. Dreaming of something high is a basic human nature, but if dreams are built with positive thoughts and hard work, nourished with confidence and knowledge and respected like a true saint then dreams will turn into success that will come to us as reality.

AUF FLÜGELN DES GESANGES

The Wesendonck-Lieder of Richard Wagner (1813-83) are composed on poems written by Mathilde Wesendonck and constitute one of the most beautiful expressions of universal love. The artistic skills of the lovers, the composition and the poetry, are unified in one single creation. Mathilde Wesendonck was married and suffered due to her impossible love for Richard Wagner. The same context of an impossible love was the inspiration for the later Tristan und Isolde with the sublime Liebenstod-scene of Isolde in which earthly love evolves in transcendental love. Wesendonck-Lieder no. 3 Im Treibhaus and no. 5 Träume were a musical draft for this opera. I considered it would be interesting to complement the program of the Wesendonck Lieder, with some Lieder from the repertoire. We can find in the additional chosen pieces analogous perspectives as those opened by the poems of Mathilde Wesendonck. Im Treibhaus we notice the negative look on reality. The I-person believes there must be another place where she would be free. Therefore we can consider the Palmenhaus as a metafore for her own ‘Golden Cage’. In Schmerzen the I-person is suffering from the knowledge that what she had positively experienced is gone. At the end of the Wesendonck Lieder cycle she will find peace again. In Träume, no. 5 of the cycle, she can dream and she finds what she was longing for in Im Treibhaus. In that way we can see the last song as an answer on Im Treibhaus:

«Wohl, ich weiß es, arme Pflanze; Ein Geschicke teilen wir, Ob umstrahlt von Licht und Glanze, Unsre Heimat ist nicht hier! » - Im Treibhaus (M. Wesendonck)

«Träume, wie wenn Frühlingssonne Aus dem Schnee die Blüten küßt, Daß zu nie geahnter Wonne Sie der neue Tag begrüßt. » - Träume (M. Wesendonck)
